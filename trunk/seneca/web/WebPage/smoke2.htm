<p align="center"><i><b><font size="1" color="#0000FF">This Information courtesy of the National
Fire Protection Association</font></b></i></p>
<p><b><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Smoke detectors aren't new. The technology has been around since
the 1960s. The single-station, battery-powered smoke detector, similar to the
one we know today, became available to consumers in the 1970s. NFPA estimates
that 93% of U.S. homes have at least one smoke detector. They save so many lives
that most states have laws requiring them in residential dwellings.</font></b></p>
<h3><i><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Still a Major Problem</font></i></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Although 13 of every 14 homes have at least one smoke detector, almost
half of home fires and three-fifths of fire deaths occur in the share of homes
with no detectors. Thousands of people still die each year in home fires where
smoke detectors aren't present.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">In addition, there are now more homes with smoke detectors that don't
work than homes without detectors at all. These poorly maintained units create a
false sense of security among occupants. Approximately one-third of homes with
smoke detectors that experience fires have smoke detectors that aren't working,
and hundreds of people die each year in these fires.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Tragically, the grave importance of installing and maintaining smoke
detectors has not yet been fully realized. Most people who die in home fires are
not in the room where the fire starts; working smoke detectors alert people to
fire and give them time to escape in a situation where minutes can mean the
difference between life and death.</font></p>
<h3><i><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Working Smoke Detectors Save Lives</font></i></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Having a smoke detector cuts your chance of dying nearly in half if
you have a home fire. By properly placing, regularly testing and maintaining
your detectors, you can ensure that they are in fact working and will alert you
if a fire breaks out. Make sure you buy only those detectors that bear the mark
of an independent testing laboratory. Some detectors operate using an
&quot;ionization&quot; sensor while others use a &quot;photo-electric&quot;
sensor. An ionization detector uses an extremely small quantity of radio-active
material to make the air in the detector chamber conduct electricity. Smoke from
a fire interferes with the electrical current and triggers the alarm. A
photoelectric detector uses a tiny light source shining on a light sensitive
sensor. The alarm is triggered when smoke from a fire interferes with the light.
All tested and labeled smoke detectors offer adequate protection if they are
properly installed and maintained.</font></p>
<h3><i><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Make Placement a Priority</font></i></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">A recent NFPA report on smoke detectors found that there is a
substantial number of households that do not have the devices on every level of
the home, as needed. The majority of fire deaths occur at night when people are
asleep. NFPA's National Fire Alarm Code (NFPA 72) says homes must have smoke
detectors on every level of the home including the basement and outside each
sleeping area. New homes are required to have a smoke detector in each sleeping
area as well.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">To slow the spread of smoke and fumes if a fire develops, NFPA
suggests that you sleep with your bedroom doors closed. If you sleep with your
bedroom doors closed, install a smoke detector inside each bedroom. Detectors
should also be installed in other areas of your home where people sleep. In new
homes, the National Fire Alarm Code requires hard-wired detectors to be
interconnected, so that if one detector is activated, all detectors will sound
the alarm signal. On floors without bedrooms, smoke detectors should be
installed in or near living areas, such as family rooms and living rooms.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Detectors that are hard-wired into the home electrical system should
be installed by a qualified electrician. If your detector plugs into a wall
socket, make sure it has a restraining device to keep its plug from being pulled
out. Never connect a detector to a circuit that could be turned off at a wall
switch. Most detectors are battery-powered and can be installed with a
screwdriver and drill and by following the manufacturer's instructions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Since smoke and deadly gases rise, detectors should be placed on the
ceiling at least 4 inches from the nearest wall, or high on a wall, 4-12 inches
from the ceiling. This 4-inch minimum is important to keep detectors out of
possible &quot;dead air&quot; spaces, because hot air is turbulent and may
bounce so much it misses spots near a surface. Installing detectors near a
window, door or fireplace is not recommended because drafts could detour smoke
away from the unit. In rooms where the ceiling has an extremely high point, such
as in vaulted ceilings, mount the detector at or near the ceiling's highest
point.</font></p>
<h3><i><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Maintenance is a Must</font></i></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">What good are smoke detectors that don't work? No good at all! That's
why it is imperative that you keep your smoke detectors fit and in good shape.
It's easy. Maintain your smoke detectors by:</font></p>

<h3><i><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Testing</font></i></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Whether your detectors are hard-wired or battery operated, NFPA
recommends testing them once a month to make sure they are operating. A working
smoke detector greatly reduces your chances of dying in a home fire. Testing is
the only way to ensure they are working to protect you. Test each detector by
pushing the test button and listening for the alarm. If you can't reach, stand
under the detector and push the test button with a broom handle.</font></p>
<h3><i><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Replacing Batteries</font></i></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">If your smoke detectors are battery operated, replace their batteries
according to the manufacturer's instructions. NFPA recommends doing this at
least once a year or when the detector chirps, alerting you that the battery
power is low. Replace the batteries immediately if you move into a new home.
Make sure no one disables your smoke detectors by borrowing batteries for other
uses. Everyone you live with should understand how critical it is to have
working smoke detectors.</font></p>
<h3><i><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Cleaning</font></i></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Just as you clean your home, your smoke detectors need to be cleaned.
Make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions about cleaning. Cobwebs and
dust usually can be removed with a vacuum cleaner attachment. If you are going
to be doing work nearby that could send dust in the air, cover the detector with
a shield. Also, shield the detector if you are painting around it, and never
paint on it. Remove the shield promptly after work is completed.</font></p>
<h3><i><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Dealing with Nuisance Alarms</font></i></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Regularly cleaning your smoke detectors and following the
manufacturer's instructions may help stop &quot;nuisance&quot; or false alarms.
If this doesn't stop them, install a fresh battery in the detectors giving
nuisance alarms. Evaluate where your detectors are placed if the problem still
persists. Cooking vapors and steam can set off a smoke detector. If the detector
is near the kitchen or bathroom, try moving it farther away. If nuisance alarms
continue, install a new smoke detector.</font></p>
<h3><i><font color="#0000FF" size="3">No Substitute for Smoke Detectors</font></i></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Fire protection in the home must start with smoke detectors. There are
many other kinds of detectors which may be designed to detect such factors as
high temperatures, rapid changes in temperature, and certain gases produced in
fires. However, these detectors are not as effective as smoke detectors in
giving the first warning when a fire breaks out. NFPA does not require heat
detectors in homes, however, they may be used for optional extra protection in
areas like kitchens, attics, and garages, where smoke detectors are susceptible
to nuisance alarms.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Tests performed on the speed of warning given by smoke detectors and
heat detectors for many types of typical home fires showed smoke detectors
consistently give first warning- often by enough of a margin to make a major
difference in your chances of escaping alive. Smoke and deadly gas spread
farther and faster than heat.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Contrary to popular belief, the smell of smoke may not wake a sleeping
person. Instead, the poisonous gases and smoke produced by a fire can numb the
senses and put one into a deeper sleep.</font></p>
<h3><i><font color="#0000FF" size="3">Smoke Detectors Are Cost-Effective</font></i></h3>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3">A battery-operated smoke detector for the home retails for less than
$10. Smoke detectors with extra features can cost up to $25. Batteries cost $1
to $2, depending on the brand. A smoke detector for a typical hard-wired system
costs $14-$18. Smoke detectors for people with hearing impairments cost
approximately $100 each. <i>In 1994, home fires caused $481,000 in damage every
hour.</i></font></p>
