<p align="center">THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE
USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW
IT CAREFULLY.</p>
<p>Purpose of this Notice: Seneca Area Emergency Services is required by law to
maintain the privacy of certain confidential health care information, known as
Protected Health Information or PHI, and to provide you with a notice of our
legal duties and privacy practices with respect to your PHI. This Notice
describes your legal rights, advises you of our privacy practices, and lets you
know how Seneca Area Emergency Services is permitted to use and disclose PHI
about you.</p>
<p>Seneca Area Emergency Services is also required to abide by the terms of the
version of this Notice currently in effect. In most situations we may use this
information as described in this Notice without your permission, but there are
some situations where we may use it only after we obtain your written
authorization, if we are required by law to do so.</p>
<p>Uses and Disclosures of PHI: Seneca Area Emergency Services may use PHI for
the purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations, in most cases
without your written permission. Examples of our use of your PHI:</p>
<p>For treatment. This includes such things as verbal and written information
that we obtain about you and use pertaining to your medical condition and
treatment provided to you by us and other medical personnel (including doctors
and nurses who give orders to allow us to provide treatment to you). It also
includes information we give to other health care personnel to whom we transfer
your care and treatment, and includes transfer of PHI via radio or telephone to
the hospital or dispatch center as well as providing the hospital with a copy of
the written record we create in the course of providing you with treatment and
transport.</p>
<p>For payment. This includes any activities we must undertake in order to get
reimbursed for the services we provide to you, including such things as
organizing your PHI and submitting bills to insurance companies (either directly
or through a third party billing company), management of billed claims for
services rendered, medical necessity determinations and reviews, utilization
review, and collection of outstanding accounts.</p>
<p>For health care operations. This includes quality assurance activities,
licensing, and training programs to ensure that our personnel meet our standards
of care and follow established policies and procedures, obtaining legal and
financial services, conducting business planning, processing grievances and
complaints, creating reports that do not individually identify you for data
collection purposes, fundraising, and certain marketing activities.</p>
<p>Fundraising. We may contact you when we are in the process of raising funds
for Seneca Area Emergency Services, or to provide you with information about our
annual subscription program.</p>
<p>Reminders for Scheduled Transports and Information on Other Services. We may
also contact you to provide you with a reminder of any scheduled appointments
for non-emergency ambulance and medical transportation, or for other information
about alternative services we provide or other health-related benefits and
services that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>Use and Disclosure of PHI Without Your Authorization. Seneca Area Emergency
Services is permitted to use PHI without your written authorization, or
opportunity to object in certain situations, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For Seneca Area Emergency Services’s use in treating you or in obtaining
    payment for services provided to you or in other health care operations;</li>
  <li>For the treatment activities of another health care provider;</li>
  <li>To another health care provider or entity for the payment activities of
    the provider or entity that receives the information (such as your hospital
    or insurance company);</li>
  <li>To another health care provider (such as the hospital to which you are
    transported) for the health care operations activities of the entity that
    receives the information as long as the entity receiving the information has
    or has had a relationship with you and the PHI pertains to that
    relationship;</li>
  <li>For health care fraud and abuse detection or for activities related to
    compliance with the law;</li>
  <li>To a family member, other relative, or close personal friend or other
    individual involved in your care if we obtain your verbal agreement to do so
    or if we give you an opportunity to object to such a disclosure and you do
    not raise an objection. We may also disclose health information to your
    family, relatives, or friends if we infer from the circumstances that you
    would not object. For example, we may assume you agree to our disclosure of
    your personal health information to your spouse when your spouse has called
    the ambulance for you. In situations where you are not capable of objecting
    (because you are not present or due to your incapacity or medical
    emergency), we may, in our professional judgment, determine that a
    disclosure to your family member, relative, or friend is in your best
    interest. In that situation, we will disclose only health information
    relevant to that person's involvement in your care. For example, we may
    inform the person who accompanied you in the ambulance that you have certain
    symptoms and we may give that person an update on your vital signs and
    treatment that is being administered by our ambulance crew;</li>
  <li>To a public health authority in certain situations (such as reporting a
    birth, death or disease as required by law, as part of a public health
    investigation, to report child or adult abuse or neglect or domestic
    violence, to report adverseevents such as product defects, or to notify a
    person about exposure to a possible communicable disease as required by law;</li>
  <li>For health oversight activities including audits or government
    investigations, inspections, disciplinary proceedings, and other
    administrative or judicial actions undertaken by the government (or their
    contractors) by law to oversee the health care system;</li>
  <li>For judicial and administrative proceedings as required by a court or
    administrative order, or in some cases in response to a subpoena or other
    legal process;</li>
  <li>For law enforcement activities in limited situations, such as when there
    is a warrant for the request, or when the information is needed to locate a
    suspect or stop a crime;</li>
  <li>For military, national defense and security and other special government
    functions;</li>
  <li>To avert a serious threat to the health and safety of a person or the
    public at large;</li>
  <li>For workers’ compensation purposes, and in compliance with workers’
    compensation laws;</li>
  <li>To coroners, medical examiners, and funeral directors for identifying a
    deceased person, determining cause of death, or carrying on their duties as
    authorized by law;</li>
  <li>If you are an organ donor, we may release health information to
    organizations that handle organ procurement or organ, eye or tissue
    transplantation or to an organ donation bank, as necessary to facilitate
    organ donation and transplantation;</li>
  <li>For research projects, but this will be subject to strict oversight and
    approvals and health information will be released only when there is a
    minimal risk to your privacy and adequate safeguards are in place in
    accordance with the law;</li>
  <li>We may use or disclose health information about you in a way that does not
    personally identify you or reveal who you are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other use or disclosure of PHI, other than those listed above will only
be made with your written authorization, (the authorization must specifically
identify the information we seek to use or disclose, as well as when and how we
seek to use or disclose it). You may revoke your authorization at any time, in
writing, except to the extent that we have already used or disclosed medical
information in reliance on that authorization.</p>
<p>Patient Rights: As a patient, you have a number of rights with respect to the
protection of your PHI, including:</p>
<p>The right to access, copy or inspect your PHI. This means you may come to our
offices and inspect and copy most of the medical information about you that we
maintain. We will normally provide you with access to this information within 30
days of your request. We may also charge you a reasonable fee for you to copy
any medical information that you have the right to access. In limited
circumstances, we may deny you access to your medical information, and you may
appeal certain types of denials.</p>
<p>We have available forms to request access to your PHI and we will provide a
written response if we deny you access and let you know your appeal rights. If
you wish to inspect and copy your medical information, you should contact the
privacy officer listed at the end of this Notice.</p>
<p>The right to amend your PHI. You have the right to ask us to amend written
medical information that we may have about you. We will generally amend your
information within 60 days of your request and will notify you when we have
amended the information. We are permitted by law to deny your request to amend
your medical information only in certain circumstances, like when we believe the
information you have asked us to amend is correct. If you wish to request that
we amend the medical information that we have about you, you should contact the
privacy officer listed at the end of this Notice.</p>
<p>The right to request an accounting of our use and disclosure of your PHI. You
may request an accounting from us of certain disclosures of your medical
information that we have made in the last six years prior to the date of your
request. We are not required to give you an accounting of information we have
used or disclosed for purposes of treatment, payment or health care operations,
or when we share your health information with our business associates, like our
billing company or a medical facility from/to which we have transported you.</p>
<p>We are also not required to give you an accounting of our uses of protected
health information for which you have already given us written authorization. If
you wish to request an accounting of the medical information about you that we
have used or disclosed that is not exempted from the accounting requirement, you
should contact the privacy officer listed at the end of this Notice.</p>
<p>The right to request that we restrict the uses and disclosures of your PHI.
You have the right to request that we restrict how we use and disclose your
medical information that we have about you for treatment, payment or health care
operations, or to restrict the information that is provided to family, friends
and other individuals involved in your health care. But if you request a
restriction and the information you asked us to restrict is needed to provide
you with emergency treatment, then we may use the PHI or disclose the PHI to a
health care provider to provide you with emergency treatment. Seneca Area
Emergency Services is not required to agree to any restrictions you request, but
any restrictions agreed to by Seneca Area Emergency Services are binding on
Seneca Area Emergency Services.</p>
<p>Internet, Electronic Mail, and the Right to Obtain Copy of Paper Notice on
Request. If we maintain a web site, we will prominently post a copy of this
Notice on our web site and make the Notice available electronically through the
web site. If you allow us, we will forward you this Notice by electronic mail
instead of on paper and you may always request a paper copy of the Notice.</p>
<p>Revisions to the Notice: Seneca Area Emergency Services reserves the right to
change the terms of this Notice at any time, and the changes will be effective
immediately and will apply to all protected health information that we maintain.
Any material changes to the Notice will be promptly posted in our facilities and
posted to our web site, if we maintain one. You can get a copy of the latest
version of this Notice by contacting the Privacy Officer identified below.</p>
<p>Your Legal Rights and Complaints: You also have the right to complain to us,
or to the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services
if you believe your privacy rights have been violated. You will not be
retaliated against in any way for filing a complaint with us or to the
government. Should you have any questions, comments or complaints you may direct
all inquiries to our privacy officer.</p>
