          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Death By Fire</font>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Nearly four thousand Americans die every year in residential fires.
          Most of these deaths are not from heat or flames but from inhaling
          smoke and toxic fumes. Smoke is actually the particles of combustion
          generated by what is burning - paper, wood, chemicals, plastic,
          upholstery, or other fuels.</font>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Buying Time</font>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">When a smoke detector senses smoke, an alarm automatically sounds.
          Most fatal home fires occur between 8:00 pm and 8:00 am. Fires often
          generate lethal amounts of unseen smoke and fumes well before flames
          are visible and before heat makes residents feel uncomfortably warm.
          As a result, many people who die in home fires are asleep and never
          wake up. When carefully purchased, installed, and maintained, smoke
          detectors can prevent such needless deaths. Smoke detectors buy time
          to get out of the house fast - before toxic fumes accumulate to lethal
          levels.</font>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Purchasing</font>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Quality, not price, should be the
          determining factor when buying
          smoke detectors. Check for the following:</font>
          <p>&nbsp;
          <ul>
            <li><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Laboratory label, insuring that samples of the model you are
              buying have been carefully tested.</font>
            <li><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Alarm loud enough to awaken the family through closed bedroom
              doors.</font>
            <li><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Malfunction signal, to warn you when batteries are weak or dead.</font>
            <li><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Manufacturer's warranty of at least five years.</font>
            <li><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">East in maintenance and cleaning.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Which Type</font>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Ionization - Contains a small amount of radioactivity that
          conducts electricity. Electric current flows continuously between two
          electrodes in the chamber. When smoke particles enter, they disturb
          the flow, causing the alarm to go off.</font>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Photoelectric - Contains a beam of light and a photocell
          within the chamber. When smoke enters, it deflects the beam, causing
          it to strike the photocell and set off the alarm.</font>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Which is better?</font>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">Ionization detectors are more sensitive to the tiny particles of
          combustion that can't been seem or smelled - those emitted by flaming
          fires. Photoelectric detectors are more sensitive to the large
          particles of combustion emitted by smoldering fires.</font>
          <p><font color="#000080" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" size="2">The differences between the two types are generally not critical,
          since the difference in response time is only a matter of seconds.
          Since most home fires produce a rich mixture of smoke types, with
          detectable amounts of both large particle and small particle smoke
          early in the fire's growth, either an ionization or a photoelectric
          detector will meet most needs.</font>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">Placement</font>
          <p>&nbsp;
          <ul>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">Buy as many smoke detectors as it takes to give your home
              complete coverage.</font>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">You obviously increase your chances of survival with each
              detector that you have, but one on each level of the house is the
              absolute minimum.</font>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">You should have a smoke detector in each bedroom, in the hallway
              close to each sleeping area and in heavily-occupied areas like the
              living room.</font>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">When bedroom doors are left open, you should have at least one
              detector in the hallway outside the bedroom area.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">Installation</font>
          <p>&nbsp;
          <ul>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">Follow the manufacturer's installation instructions.</font>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">On the ceilings, mount the device away from corners and walls,
              which have dead air space nearby. About eight to ten inches is the
              recommended distance.</font>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">On walls, install the detectors high, because smoke rises, and
              place them eight to ten inches away from corners and ceilings.</font>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">Install smoke detectors at least three feet from vents, which
              might recirculate the smoke.</font>
            <li><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">Never place smoke detectors on uninsulated walls or ceilings.
              Extreme temperatures can ruin batteries and prevent smoke from
              reaching the detectors.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">Exit Drills in the Home</font>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">Smoke detectors provide an early warning system to allow you and
          your family extra time to get out of the house fast during a fire.</font>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold" color="#000080">IF THE ALARM SOUNDS... be sure each family member knows what the
          alarm sounds like and what to do. Families should regularly practice
          Operation EDITH - Exit Drills In The Home. This means having a
          prepared escape plan, with two possible escape routes from every room,
          and a prearranged meeting place outside the house. Families should
          actually run through a fire drill at least twice a year.</font>
